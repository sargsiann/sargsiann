# 👋 Hi, I'm David

I'm a passionate full-stack and system-level developer with experience in both modern web frameworks and low-level C programming. I enjoy building applications that span from the browser to the terminal.

## 🧠 What I Know

### 💻 Full-Stack & Frontend
- **React** / **Redux**
- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript** / **JavaScript**
- **Ant Design (ANTD)**
- **Firebase SDK**

### ⚙️ Backend & Low-Level
- **C language** — for systems programming, including:
  - Custom shell executors
  - Ray tracing demos (`miniRT`)
  - Client-server socket projects (TCP communication, protocol design)
- **Linux** — CLI tools, process management, memory, networking

## 🛠 Projects I’ve Enjoyed Building
- 🐚 **MiniShell** — A simplified Unix shell in C with parsing, redirection, and piping
- 🌌 **MiniRT** — A raytracer that renders 3D scenes from scratch using math and graphics logic
- 🌐 **Execution Server** — TCP-based server that receives commands, executes them, and returns output
- ⚙️ **Full-stack Web Apps** — React/Next.js + Firebase or custom APIs

## ❤️ What I Love
I love understanding how things work under the hood. Whether it's designing clean frontends or crafting my own server protocols in C, I’m always up for building something real and technical.
